# nest-combolock
Turns my Nest thermostat into a combination lock.

This is so I can disable my alarm system from the top of the stairs if I want to enable the motion detection. Read more about why I would do something this ridiculous [here](https://medium.com/@rowborg/using-my-nest-thermostat-as-a-combination-lock-d536e615cbbf).

This is a python3 app that is easy to run or to deploy to Heroku. It's hard coded to integrate with Alarm.com using [this package](https://github.com/Xorso/pyalarmdotcom) but you can make it do whatever you want when the combination is entered.

Enjoy!
